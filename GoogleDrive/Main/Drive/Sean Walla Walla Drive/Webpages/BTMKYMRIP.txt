About
Behind The Meme is a YouTube webseries that explains the origins of and offers analysis on trending memes. Since its launch in August 2016, the series has grown into a popular meme explainer on the video-sharing platform, garnering over 600,000 subscribers and 50 million channel views within the first six months. Despite its active presence on YouTube, the series has been the target of derision in certain meme communities due to its tone, unoriginal content, and the perception that he kills memes after he reviews them by making them accessible to normies.
Online History
Behind the Meme's YouTube channel launched on August 12th, 2016.[1] The channel is run by Kyle Bryce. On his channel, he lists a California PO Box. His first video was uploaded on August 13th, explaining Dicks Out For Harambe (shown below).

Anthony Fantano Parody
On November 12th, 2016, thatistheplan, the meme-explainer channel of Anthony Fantano, released a video on Rickrolling parodying the style of Behind The Meme. Fantano criticizes Behind the Meme's scripts by reading the entry in broken english. He also says the channel talks down to its audience like its full of 6 year olds and accuses the channel of regurgitating information on Know Your Meme.



The following day, Behind The Meme responded to Fantano's video by posting a video where he addressed some of the criticisms Fantano lobbed and got his mom to roast him by calling him a geek.



Criticisms
Though popular, Behind the Meme is despised in certain meme communities. Often, he is accused of being a normieand cancer in comments on his videos (ex: shown below).[2]

 


The channel is particularly loathed on meme-focused subreddits such as /r/dankmemes and /r/MemeEconomy. For example, on March 8th, 2017, an image of a Behind The Meme comments section asking the channel to review Expanding Brain caused a stir in both subreddits. In /r/dankmemes, the screenshot was posted with the title, "Behind the meme, if you're out there, on Reddit, I'm begging you, don't do this to us. This meme is only a boy, it has so much to live for" (shown below).[3]

 


On /r/MemeEconomy, the subreddit responds to Behind the Meme actions by crying "Sell!" whenever he reviews or is encouraged to review a meme.[4]
Zenzi
On February 19th, 2017, an anonymous 4chan user took to /r9k/ to complain about Behind the Meme and ask how 4chan could take it down. In response, another user suggested that in every video, 4chan commenters demand he cover "Zenzi," a meme that doesn't exist, and downvote every video in which he doesn't cover Zenzi, which they thought would result in Behind The Meme getting frustrated and quitting (screenshot shown below). It appears the original thread has been deleted, though a similar thread has been archived.

 


Behind The Meme quickly discovered what was going on and thwarted the attempted 4chan raid by creating an explainer video for Zenzi the same day as the raid. The video turned into less of an explainer and more of an extended riff on the elitism of some meme communities. Behind The Meme's quick and accurate response to Zenzi resulted in the Zenzi raid being deemed a failure.



Plagiarism Accusations
Behind the Meme has been accused in the past for allegedly plagiarizing Know Your Meme. In Anthony Fantano's parody of Behind the Meme, he sarcastically says "This is the part where I regurgitate information I found on Know Your Meme, but you're so stupid, you think I researched it." The channel's tendency to steal Know Your Meme information has been a noticeable trend for its followers. For example, in his episode for What in Tarnation, he says:[6]
“What in Tarnation?” is an older saying that is often associated with the Southern states of America.
The "About" section for the Know Your Meme entry for the meme reads:
“What in Tarnation?” is a rhetorical question meaning “what in damnation?”, which is often associated with Americans living in the Southern United States expressing incredulous bewilderment.
Doxxing
On June 3rd, 2017, Behind The Meme uploaded a "Draw My Life" episode to his channel in which he admitted his name was Kyle Bryce (shown below). On August 4th, 2017, he uploaded a since-deleted video explaining Crash Bandicoot Woah. This led to him being doxxed.



On August 5th, 2017, Bryce was doxxed by user Jaxon Richardson of Hollaforums, who posted links to Bryce's social media profiles and his address. A thread was posted to /r/OutOftheLoop[7] about the doxxing the next day. This led to increased criticism of the channel and another wave of harsh criticism, particularly on /r/memeeconomy and 4chan, though it is currently unclear the extent to which the doxxing has affected Bryce's personal life.
